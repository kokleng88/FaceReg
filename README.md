# FaceReg
Fun App on Face Detection using OpenCV and Python Notebooks


Disclaimer: 

I have only tested this app on my Windows 11 system.

To run the main FaceReg.ipynb notebook properly,
the python 3.9 environment (Windows App) should be downloaded and installed on the windows system.
The main python modules (mentioned in the requirements.txt file) should be installed on the system as well.
A sample shortcut is provided for easier access.

a PC Camera or Laptop Camera required for this app.
No camera recording is done using the original python codes 
(all source codes on the Python Notebook are shown)
Please do not edit or branch out to add such recording feature(s) 
and I assume no responsibility on any consequence of such action.

Thanks to the many other python source site contributors so as to allow me to trouble-shoot and complete this app.

Btw, I would not know how to ask Mr Leonardo Da Vinci for using Moni Lisa's pic.
Hope he does not mind....

Enjoy!
